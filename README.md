## LangNeuralNetwork
Custom neural network that learns to predicts language of a given input String

The network will train on the languages selected in the testing[] array.

# Command Documentation:

train #: trains the neural network for given number of iterations

test: feeds given string into neural network and outputs values

trial: runs test data for selected language (selected via whole name, three letter abreviation or corresponding number)

alltrial: runs test data for all languages in testing[] (all languages the network is training on)

togdetail: toggle printing advanced data (full predictions)

togcount: toggle printing count

togacc: toggle printing accuracy

togstep (new step): changes step size of neural network
